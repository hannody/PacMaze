Hello,

I have used the following packages to achieve this demo:
1- Dynamic maze generation: Maze Generator, free, source: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/maze-generator-38689

I had to modify the MazeSpawner.cs script to accomodate my logic and scenario, all the code that I have added are encolsed by:

//----------------------------- mohanad
my code is here!                        
//----------------------------------------------------

2- I have used Brackes tutorial as reference for:
	A- Smooth camera movement (altered a bit).
	B- Dynamic Nav Mesh generation to support this demo scenario, no code copied from the tutorial, only some insghits.

3- I have some old code that I have used in other games, I have reused some parts of them, such code was written by myself, but in few cases I might got some from the web, 
	anyhow, I do not think I have a copy and paste code.

4- Art and SFX/Music are all from Unity Assets Store.
